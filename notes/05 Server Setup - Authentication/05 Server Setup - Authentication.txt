If anyone has been having issues with database connection with mongoose, try this refactor:



// DB Setup
mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost/auth", { useNewUrlParser: true });
 
const connection = mongoose.connection;
 
connection.on("connected", function() {
  console.log("connected to db");
});
